# Document Classification Project

This project classifies documents into categories based on keywords. It is designed to process a folder of text documents and classify them according to a provided list of categories and keywords.

## How to Run

1. Run the `PROJECT.py` script.
2. When prompted, provide the path to the file that contains the definition of the categories and keywords.
3. Then, provide the name of the file that contains the definition of the categories and keywords.
4. Next, provide the path to the folder that contains the document files to be processed.
5. Finally, provide the name of the folder that contains the document files to be processed.

The program will generate two output files:
- A txt file containing the category of the documents.
- A txt file containing the statistics of the classification.

## Project Structure

- `PROJECT.py`: The main script that runs the document classification.
